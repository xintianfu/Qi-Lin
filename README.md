# Qi-Lin
Qi Lin is a 3D compositing piece created in Blender, where the mythical creature appears in real-world footage and symbolically awakens still objects with vitality and luck.

> **Tools:** Blender · Motion Tracking · Rigging · Animation · Compositing  
> **Focus:** Integrating 3D mythical creatures into real-world environments through visual storytelling.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
**Qilin** is a mixed-media animation project that blends the **mythical and the real**.  
Using **Blender’s motion tracking** and **rigging tools**, I brought a digital *Qilin* — a legendary creature symbolizing purity and wisdom — into real-world scenes.  
The project explores how fantasy and reality can coexist through seamless 3D compositing and cinematic storytelling.

## 🧠 **Technical Skills Applied**
- 🎥 **Motion Tracking:** Matched real-world camera movement with virtual 3D space.  
- 🦴 **Rigging & Animation:** Created skeletal rigs to animate the Qilin model naturally.  
- 🎨 **Material & Lighting:** Designed materials and lighting that reflect real-world environments for visual harmony.  
- 🌍 **Scene Integration:** Blended 3D renders with real footage using compositing and shadow catching.

## 🎬 **Story & Structure**
The film is divided into **three scenes**, set across **seven different locations**, each symbolizing a stage in the creature’s awakening.

1. **Awakening of the Book** —  
   A mysterious book opens, summoning the mythical Qilin from ancient pages into the real world.

2. **The Magic of Qilin** —  
   The Qilin explores the human world, interacting with light, reflection, and natural elements, merging imagination and presence.

3. **Dream or Reality?** —  
   Clouds drifted toward m, and suddenly, I woke up. Everything around me was unchanged, yet the air still shimmered with its presence. I couldn’t tell whether it was a dream, or a glimpse into another world.

## 🧩 **Design Concept**
Through **mythical imagery** and **real-world motion**, the project investigates how digital creatures can evoke *spiritual symbolism* and *emotional resonance* when placed in familiar environments.  
By merging **cinematic realism** with **3D fantasy**, *Qilin* transforms myth into a sensory experience — one that challenges how we perceive “reality.”
